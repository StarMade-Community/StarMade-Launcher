Let's review the refactoring plan and check off what we've accomplished so far:

# Refactoring Plan for StarMadeLauncher:

## Architectural Restructuring

### Model:
- [x] `GameVersionManager` (in `smlauncher.core.model`)
	- Manages game versions and branches
	- Handles version parsing and retrieval

### View:
- [x] Break UI into separate component classes
	- Created `TopPanel`
	- Created `LeftSidePanel`
	- Created `FooterPanel`
	- Created base `BasePanel`
	- Implemented navigation panels:
		- `NewsPanel`
		- `ForumsPanel`
		- `CommunityPanel`
		- `ContentPanel`

### Configuration:
- [x] `LaunchConfigManager` (in `smlauncher.core.config`)
	- Manages launcher settings
	- Handles configuration file reading/writing

### Controller:
- [x] `MainController` (in `smlauncher.ui.controllers`)
	- Coordinates interactions between model and view
	- Manages configuration and version-related actions

## Error Handling and Logging
- [x] `LauncherLogger` (in `smlauncher.util.logging`)
	- Comprehensive logging utility
	- Supports different log levels
	- Handles log file rotation
	- Provides detailed error tracking

## Event Handling
- Partially implemented through `MainController`
- More work needed on event management system

## UI Refactoring
- [x] Extracted UI creation methods
- [x] Created UI component factory methods within base classes
- [x] Implemented consistent styling
- [x] Created modular, reusable UI components

## Configuration and Settings
- [x] Created more robust configuration management
- [x] Implemented settings facade
- [x] Added basic validation

## Platform Abstraction
- Partially addressed through `GameVersionManager`
- Needs more work on OS-specific operations

Remaining major tasks from the original plan:
1. Implement a more comprehensive event bus/management system
2. Create more advanced dependency injection
3. Improve platform-specific service interfaces
4. Add more detailed update and download management
5. Create more advanced error handling mechanisms
6. Implement comprehensive testing
7. Add more runtime configuration change support

Would you like to focus on one of these remaining areas next? Some potential next steps could be:
1. Implementing a more robust event management system
2. Creating platform-specific service interfaces
3. Developing a more advanced download/update service
4. Adding more comprehensive error handling and reporting
