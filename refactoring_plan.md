Refactoring Plan for StarMadeLauncher:

Architectural Restructuring


Create a clear MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern

Model:

LauncherModel (central data management)
GameVersionManager (handle version-related logic)
LaunchConfigManager (manage launch settings)


View:

Break UI into separate component classes
Create base LauncherFrame class
Separate panels into modular components


Controller:

LauncherController to manage interactions between Model and View
Separate controllers for different UI sections (VersionController, UpdateController, etc.)






UI Refactoring


Extract UI creation methods into separate classes

TopPanel
LeftSidePanel
FooterPanel
VersionSelectionPanel
ServerConfigPanel


Create a UIComponentFactory to standardize component creation
Implement a more flexible layout management system
Use dependency injection for shared resources and configuration


Event Handling Improvements


Create a centralized event bus/management system
Implement more granular event listeners
Separate UI interaction logic from core business logic
Use strategy pattern for different interaction scenarios


Configuration and Settings


Create a more robust configuration management system
Implement a settings facade for easier configuration access
Add validation and error handling for configuration
Support more flexible runtime configuration changes


Update and Download Management


Refactor UpdaterThread into a more generic download/update service
Create abstract interfaces for download processes
Implement better progress tracking and error handling
Support multiple concurrent download types


Error Handling and Logging


Create a centralized error handling mechanism
Implement more detailed logging
Add user-friendly error reporting
Create custom exception hierarchies


Platform Abstraction


Create platform-specific service interfaces
Implement strategies for OS-specific operations
Improve current OperatingSystem enum with more robust detection and handling


Dependency Management


Use dependency injection (consider lightweight DI frameworks)
Create clear interfaces for core services
Minimize tight coupling between components
Improve testability of individual components


Performance and Memory Management


Optimize UI rendering
Implement lazy loading for heavy components
Create more efficient resource management
Add memory usage monitoring


Code Quality Improvements


Break down large methods into smaller, focused methods
Remove duplicate code
Improve naming conventions
Add comprehensive documentation
Create clear separation between UI logic and business logic
